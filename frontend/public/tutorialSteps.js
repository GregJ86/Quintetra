A meld is when you play multiple cards together in a set — like a pair, three-of-a-kind, or a straight. The better the meld, the more gold you earn!

Let’s break it down step-by-step.`,

The more cards you meld at once, the bigger the multiplier you’ll get!`,

Wager gold and pick 1 of 5 facedown cards. Results:

- ♦️ Diamond = 5x
- ♠️ Spade = 10x`,
